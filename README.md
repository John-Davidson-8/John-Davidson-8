### Hello, my name is John Davidson. I am a web developer.

Living and learning, watching and reading, listening and listening somemore! The coding life! One year in and how did I live so long withoutthese bugs. My name is John Davidson, one of those late starters on the coding journey. My new found life now consists of building websites/apps
and breaking them. Figuring out how to fix them is now all consuming.
    

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on various Frontend Mentor projects mostly with HTML, CSS (Flexbox and Grid), Git and Github. Also, the portfolio website is under construction as I tackle the meaty language that is Javascript.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning HTML, CSS (Flexbox and Grid), Javascript, Git, and Github. Looking to dive into the deep waters of open source and working with other like minded folk. 

ðŸ‘¯ Looking to dive into the deep waters of open source and working with others. Looking to learn and gain experience on collaborative projects. 

ðŸ¤” Always looking for help and advice on issues ranging from tips for portfolio website to "oh no! Why did that media queary screw up the whole site!"
